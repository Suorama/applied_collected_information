GT2560A board have 5 stepper driver place. That is enough to many purposes.

I found how I can use nicely example TMC2209 drivers with UART feature.
 - Because I do not use Display or SD card connectors, there is lots of pins to use.
 - Example pim 8, at LCD connector is nicely to RXD2 (PH0) at MCU.
Well, because I do not need anymore than 4 drivers X, Y, Z1 and Z2 to silent, I do not need more UART channels.
TMC2209 can addressed via MS1 and MS2 pins to address 0, 1, 2 and 3.
 00 = 0
 01 = 1
 10 = 2
 11 = 3
Do not use MS3 jumper, that pin is your UART RX pin.

So, give addresses to the drivers with MS1 and MS2 pins.
Make wire what you can connect one end to LCD connector pin 8 and other ends to the drivers RX pins. So you need a branched cord.
Make sure that your drivers extra pins not hit anything (diag and vref). If so, you can cut downside ins off or do something else if you not want cut.

With Klipper you can use all UART features.
Your uart_pin is PH0 (if you chose same than I) for all drivers. Uart_address is that address what you put with MS1 and MS2 jumpers. 

tmc2209 stepper_x]
uart_pin: PH0
uart_address: 0
interpolate: True
run_current: 0.800
hold_current: 0.500
sense_resistor: 0.110
stealthchop_threshold: 999999

[tmc2209 stepper_y]
uart_pin: PH0
uart_address: 1
interpolate: True
run_current: 0.800
hold_current: 0.500
sense_resistor: 0.110
stealthchop_threshold: 999999

Interpolation gives 256 microsteps and stealthchop_treshold: 999999 give more quietness. Well same time those gine a bit less accuracy to positioining.
But now you can adjust run and hold current. Of cource, if hold current is different, could positioning chance...

But if oll those anti accuracy features affect about 0.001mm, then there could be something like 0.003mm error.

With BL-Touch, I use one endstop with 5V, GND and signal and other endstop with GND and signal.
Then I look at the schematic what pins those are and use these with klipper.

Later I plan add also filment runout sensor, and I plan to use LCD connector 5V pin 1, GND pin 2 and example pin 3 (PH3) with it.
That because there is not more than 6 that kind of inputs normally. And those are used:
 1. X endstop
 2. Y endstop
 3. Z1 endstop
 4. Z2 endstop
 5. BL-Touch 
 6. BL-Touch
