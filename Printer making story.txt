I decide to make my own pinter...

I make it's base at 20 x 20mm and 20 x 40mm alumium profile, what I collected as crap from other peoples. (base is complete)
To core xy movements I use Layerfused desing, because it fits 20 x 20 profile. Otherwise printer differs "much". (Core xy is complete)
I plan to use three Z axis with 8mm srewbars and linears. (linears, bars and motors on site, nuts is ordered)
HotBed is 235 x 235mm from Creality. (on site)
I plan to use BBT SKR Pro 1.2 motherboard with TMC2209 and DRV8825 drivers. (MB ordered drvers is on site)
There is also BTT Pi v1.2 and BTT TFT3.5 V2.1 to the Klipper. (Pi is on site, tft is ordered)
I plan to use Biqu Orbiter v2.0 and Micro Swiss fulmetal titan hotend. (Micro Swiss is on site, Orbiter is ordered)
Fanless 24V 500W NiuGuy Leo power. (Power is on site)

Costs...
 - profiles, perhaps I add 50€ from those.
 - Stepper motors is recycled, but perhaps 10€.
 - Belt is recycled, 5€ (I have new one too..)
 - Hotbed 19,68€
 - Linears 14,27€ + 28,14€ + 10€ from recycled ones = 52.41€
 - BTT SKR Pro 46.73$ = 43,85€
 - BTT Pi 33,68$ = 31,60€
 - BTT tft 19.68$ = 18,47€
 - Biqu Orbiter 51.42$ = 48,23€
 - BTT Anti backslash nuts 2,36$ = 2,21€
 - BTT Chaft couplers 7,43$ = 6,97€
 - Micro Swiss recycled, but nearly new, 10€
 - T-slot L-shape 2020 3,84€
 - Fystech bed isulator matt 1,18€
 - TMC2209 x 5 32,59€
 - Timing Pulleys x 10 8,64€
 - Power 20,91€
 And lots of stuff what I'm not become to use with that project... =D
365,58€ to this. Well I collect lots of parts same time and get three working printers also...
So perhaps I can left those recycled parts without price. But there those are anyway.
