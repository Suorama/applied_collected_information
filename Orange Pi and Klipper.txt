Orange Pi

- Install Armbian to Orange Pi
   - Goto to the Orange Pi site and locate your OPi model and choose Armbian (bullseye). It could be minimal.
   - "Burn" disk image to the OPi or sd card. (Balena Etcher)
   - Start OPi with new armbian OS.
   - Find your OPi from network or use display etc. and start configuring.
   - Add user, example "pi" (installation ask to do that). I chose a klipper, works.
   - Make updates (apt update, apt upgrade)

KLIPPER

- Install KIAUH to Orange Pi
   - First install GIT
     - [sudo apt-get install git -y]
   - Copy KIAUH to the crated user home directory (not as root account, but must be sudoer)
     - [cd ~]
     - [git clone https://github.com/th33xitus/kiauh.git]
   - Start KIAUH
     - [./kiauh/kiauh.sh}
   - Use KIAUH to install Klipper, Moonraker (, FLUIDD and KlipperScreen)
   
- Configure Klipper to your printer.
   - Depens your printer, use Klipper documentation.
   
I test that with Orange Pi Zero (Allwinner H2+ and 512mb).
All seems to work like a RPi 3b. Only amount of memory is half.
Just with Klipper and printer there is 22% memory usage and after ADXL345 29%.
System load are about 0.65 - 0.02 level. Sometimes a bit over 1.
I put small heatsink to top oft the processor and system fam blows over that heatsink.
Then temps keeps below 50C. If there is not any cooling, temperature could rise over 60C level.
