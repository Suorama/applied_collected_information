Somethings what I'v tested and thinked to work.

First. If PSU tell's there is 180W to share, that should be true.
Of cource some manufacturers promise too much or there is temp problems is max power is used any longer than few seconds.
I got few days ago a pile of 3D printer stuff. "Seller" told me that he's old printer has a under power PSU and that why everything goes wrong.
I got the pile of stuff and look that PSU. It is 250W power. (My own GEEETech use 180W PSU).
Well, if there is normal heatbed like those Anet A6 etc. printers have, it takes about 120W when it heat.
Normally Nozzle heater is 40 - 50 W, and more often it is 40W.
Like my GEEETech little 180W PSU does not think anythting when I put that 160W load to the V+ and V- posts.
If I adjust PSU voltage to 12,3V, it keeps that 12,3V without any difficulties when I connect that 160W load.
Same if I use 12,5V.
So, why voltage drop dramatically and bed heat slower etc. Wiring.
If you want to be sure that Volts not drop to MB and MCU, you must at least wiring own wires to MB, Heatbed and Nozzle heater from PSU.
Of cource you must use some kind of "relay". SSD, MosFET or relay.
SSD is way too much expensive for that. Ralays are too noisy and not work well with PWM.
Well, there is MosFET already at the motherboard...
Thats true. But that is the oroginal reason...
Because Power comes first to MB via wires. When there is not load, PSU side and MB side of the wires show same voltage.
If I start bed heating, then that 120W with 12V mean 10A current.
When power "moves" in leads, there is some kind of resistance. More power, "more resistance" or resistance feels more.
That mean, some of power loss to the wires. So, beacuse current keeps "the same", voltage drops.
That mean also, stepper motors have less space to work, fans runs slower, etc. Then we put Nozzle heater also on...

I found 10 PCS LR7843 MosFET modules at price of 3.50€.
So, I decide to test what those are.

I also found site, where is more info of that and many others, what I found.

One switching output
Ultra low 3.3mΩ Rds(on) resistance
2.5V – 20V input control voltage with optoisolation
6 – 28V output switching voltage
15A continuous current handling capability (See notes below)
If driven with PWM, the maximum peak current can be greater up to 30A or more.
3.3 and 5V logic compatible (See notes below)

So, I can use that module with 12V or 24V printers. When use 24V printers, is better use MCU pin instead 24V controll pins from MB's motherboard with voltage dropper.

So, example that 10A bed shoud work easily. And 3.3A Nozzle cardridge more easily.

And I think, I can use couple parallel... perhaps...

There is also example AOD4184 what looks at first very promising. 40V and 50A. But truth is different. That FET can handle 10A continously.

So, it cost about 0.70€ to solve that problem. Well, I need some wires too.

Now, I can put own wires to MB, HB and E0 from PSU.
MB goes mormally, but I must add some fat wires to the MosFET's. 
Theoretically 1.5mm2 should handle 10A. Well, that is true. That wire does not burn with 10A current. So, it would be better if use thicker wires.
These wires from PSU, goes FET module [Power supply and Load power] hole.
It is nicier if I are already disconnect heater wires from MB and I can add both wires same time to the connector.
Negative wire from PSU goes to [Power supply ground] post. And negative from heater, goes to [Load ground] post.
If that was 12V system, old MB heater post must connect to MosFet module [PWM] and [GND] posts at the other end os the module.

What happens?
 - PSU give 12.5V to the its posts.
 - MB got after it's own wiring example 12.4V
 - Heatbed and Extruder nozzle heater got nothing, but MosFET's are ready.
 - I put bed heater on.
 - BedHeater MosFET give power to the bed.
 - PSU voltage is still 12.5V and MB got 12.4V after its own wiring.
 - Hotbed get 12,1V because wire losses are bigger.
 - I put Nozzle heater on.
 - NozzleHeater MosFET allow power flow to the cardridge.
 - PSU voltage is stil 12.5V, MB got 12.4V, Hotbed got 12.1V and Nozzle cardridge got 12.2V
 - Because of losses, I adjust voltage to 12.5V. So every component got at least 12V. And 0.5V is not that much over.
