Mainly notes to me about 3D printing hardware

Klipper helps me to use almost any 3D printing motherboard to almost anything.
Not may need to buy faster or fancier MBÂ´s,
exept if your arsenal does not include enough driver spaces or other I/O points. Or you just want...
Remember, you can use multiple MB:s...

1. How to use cheap Orange Pi (Zero) with Klipper and ADXL345

2. GEEETech GT2560A with TMC2209 UART, BL-TOUCH, 2 x separate drived Z-azis and endstops.
